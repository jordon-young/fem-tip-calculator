### Official Brief

From the [Tip Calculator Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX) page on Frontend Mentor's website:

> Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
>
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
>
> Users should be able to:
>
> - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### FEM Provided Resources

- Starting File Structure
- Minimalistic [Style Guide](./assets/design/style-guide.md)
- Images Included in Design
- [Design Screenshots](./assets/design/) (Desktop, Active States, Mobile)

### My Goals

- Make the Design Responsive
- Use SCSS for Styling
- Overcome iOS Specific Challenges:
  - Sticky Hover on Touch
  - Request Specific Keyboard Layout per Input

### Foreword

### Recreating the Design

The first challenge when using the free version of Frontend Mentor is always to recreate the design as no design files are provided. The best way I've found to get accurate measurements is to recreate the design in Figma or Adobe XD.

From the ground up, I create and compose increasingly complex UI components. I save and reuse styles whenever possible to keep things organized and simple for the developer (me :smile:). Each time I use an instance of a component in a new, more complex component, I check how things resize, adding layout constraints as necessary.

The images below show the Figma components I used to build the design. A doted line surrounds each component and its variants.

_The beauty of using Figma components in this way is that a change in the original component populates everywhere that component is used (including inside other components)._

### Making the Design Responsive

Having only two fixed layouts is not fully embracing the spirit of responsive web design. I wanted the added challenge of developing several breakpoints, so I flexed my design muscles and specified how the page should resize using the mobile and desktop layouts as endpoints.

|                    Mobile Layout                    |                         Desktop Layout                          |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![Mobile Layout](./assets/design/mobile-design.jpg) | ![Desktop Layout](./assets/design/desktop-design-completed.jpg) |

For project demonstration, I decided that fluidly transitioning between breakpoints (matching card widths) was the priority; this lead to the midpoint (720px to 875px) looking uncomfortably wide, but remembering that this is a coding challenge, I kept it simple.

| Breakpoint |                        Min-Width to Max-Width                         |
| :--------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   375px    | ![Breakpoint Preview](./assets/solution/screenshots/breakpoint_0.png) |
|   576px    | ![Breakpoint Preview](./assets/solution/screenshots/breakpoint_1.png) |
|   720px    | ![Breakpoint Preview](./assets/solution/screenshots/breakpoint_2.png) |
|   875px    | ![Breakpoint Preview](./assets/solution/screenshots/breakpoint_3.png) |
|   1047px   | ![Breakpoint Preview](./assets/solution/screenshots/breakpoint_4.png) |
