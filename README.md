# The Challenge

From the [Tip Calculator Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX) page on Frontend Mentor's website:

> ## Brief
>
> Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
>
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
>
> Users should be able to:
>
> - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

Refer to [Calculations](#calculations) for explanation on tip amount discrepancy.

<br />

## Calculations

Total Amount 142.55
Tip 15% (21.3825)
Tip / 5 = 4.2765 [rounding]=> $4.28 / person
Total + Tip = 163.9325
Total + Tip / 5 = 32.7865 [rounding]=> $32.79 / person

4.27 _ 5 => 21.35 != 21.3825 <= 4.2765 _ 5
4.28 \* 5 => 21.4 Also not equal, but overtips ~0.2 instead of under tipping 0.325

# Technical Summary

## Semantic HTML5

Content is organized using semantic tags whenever possible to aid screenreaders in understanding the document's information heirarchy.
When strictly presenational, generic tags, such as `<div>` and `<span>`, are used as they convey no inherent meaning to developers or assistive technologies.

I typically like to make use of `<section>`, but since there were no headings for `id="input-card"` and `id="display-card"`, and every input came with a label, it wasn't appropriate. I didn't see any value in nesting headings inside of labels.

### Semantic Tags in Document Stucture

```html
<!-- Selection from index.html --->

<body>
  <header>
    <!-- Logo --->
  </header>

  <main>
    <form id="tip-calculator">
      <div id="input-card">
        <!-- Input --->
      </div>
      <div id="display-card">
        <!-- Output & Reset --->
      </div>
    </form>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <!-- Attribution --->
  </footer>
</body>
```

### Using `<form>` Elements

`<input>` for user input :scream:; `<output>` for displaying calculated tip and total values. Screen readers automatically read when `<output>` value is changed.

```html
<!-- Selection from index.html;  Some attributes and elements removed. -->

<form id="tip-calculator">
  <div id="input-card">
    <!-- Amount Billed -->
    <input type="number" />

    <!-- Tip Percent -->
    <fieldset>
      <!-- Predefined -->
      <input type="radio" />
      <input type="radio" />
      <input type="radio" />
      <input type="radio" />
      <input type="radio" />
      <input type="radio" />

      <!-- Custom -->
      <input type="number" />
    </fieldset>

    <!-- Number of People -->
    <input type="number" />
  </div>

  <div id="display-card">
    <!-- Tip Amount -->
    <output id="tip-amount"></output>

    <!-- Total Amount -->
    <output id="total-amount"></output>

    <!-- Form Reset -->
    <input type="reset" />
  </div>
</form>
```

### Leveraging `<input>` Validity

Using attributes, the HTML validates the form and inputs. CSS styling and JavaScript execution in this project are tied directly to HTML input validation states and events.

```html
<!-- Selection from index.html; Some attributes removed. -->

<input id="amount-billed" type="number" step="0.01" min="0" max="1000000" />

<input id="number-of-people" type="number" min="1" max="100" />
```

### `<form>` Reset

Unexpectedly, the `input[type=reset]` button didn't work on iOS Safari/Chrome, so I had to create methods to manually clear `<input>` and reset `<output>` values.

## JavaScript

The [Tip Calculator JavaScript](./assets/scripts/) is organized into four modules.
Modules are used in this project primarily for organization, maintenance, and digestability.

### input_card.js

#### display_card.js

#### tip_calculator.js

#### setup.js

```js
import * as tip_calculator from "./tip_calculator.js";

// Initializes Event Listeners and Handlers
tip_calculator.watch();
```

- CSS3
  - Root font-size: 62.5%;
  - Element sizing with REM (256px => 25.6rem)
  - Media Queries
    - Mobile First (min-width)
    - Primary Input Hover Detection (hover: hover)
    - Prefers Reduced Motion overrides transitions
- SCSS / SASS (CSS3)
  - Partial files for theme, components, and layout
  - Mixins with content blocks for breakpoints and managing hover on primarily touch devices
